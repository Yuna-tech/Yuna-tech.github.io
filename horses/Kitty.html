<h1>**SOLD**</h1>
<h2>"Kitty"</h2>
<h3>Extremely smooth and athletic tall drink o' water! She is 16.1H of gentle spirit, and on many occasions, she has been turned out to pasture for months and months, and then with no prep, we just bring her back up and throw a saddle on her and take a ride, or even throw her on the trailer and haul to the trails. She has had two beautiful colts, the first which is a gorgeous bay, and the second is on her side now, a beautifully marked robust bay and white colt. Kitty was put through our training program when she was started under saddle and is trained to back, side pass, pivot, forehand turn, move off leg pressure, step over logs to be mounted in the woods,ride by highway traffic, tractors, 4 wheelers, cattle, chickens, turkeys, goats, and will stall or pasture, but has spent much of her life in the pasture. She rides beautifully smooth with no trick to shoeing -- she has spent most of her life barefoot and performs a super smooth four beat racking gait, as well as a smooth canter, barefoot. Delightfully athletic, she'd make a great mountain horse. She is for sale in a 2-for-1 package with her TWHBEA spotted colt for $6500 for the pair.</h3>
