<h1>"Sadie"</h1>
<h2>Beautiful big-boned, stocky, sweet, four-beat-gaited buckskin tobiano Tennessee Walking Horse mare with excellent bloodlines and natural sure-footed athletic ability. This filly's parents are all proven on the trail and some even in the show ring. No sloppy pacing in her background and you can see in the videos on this page how natural and easy she gaits. Sadie will make a lifetime kind of horse for a family. We have raised her sire, her dam, her grandparents and even great grandparents. She comes with vaccinations, TWHBEA registration, lots of training, including trailer loading, tying, hoof trims, obstacles, exposure to highway traffic, 4-wheelers, tractors, dogs, goats, cattle, and ponying training. $2500</h2>
