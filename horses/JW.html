<h1>"JW"</h1>
<h3>Beautifully marked, head full of sense, big boned, wide chest, big rump, one nice Tennessee Walking Horse colt! He is Jackpot's 'uncle', born out of Jackpot's granddam, Kitty. This is going to be one sane, gentle, family-type horse that will be rugged enough for the biggest man, and gentle enough for the youngsters in the family. His markings are so flashy and beautiful, and I particularly love his big bone structure. He will have a beautiful smooth gait with a slow, rocking chair canter. JW already knows how to pick up his feet for hoof cleaning, load in a trailer, walk over obstacles on the obstacle course, be ponied by another horse, be ponied by a 4-wheeler, stand tied while tractors haul round bales by and move dirt, and he has had several baths in his life. He has grown up with cattle, goats, a pig, other horses in a natural environment, crossing creeks and traveling through muddy areas at will. I have hauled him to the vet when I take other horses, just to give him the experience. He is weaned and ready for his new home, and his price includes TWHBEA registration, vaccinations, and negative coggins. $2500</h3>
