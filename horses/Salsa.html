<h1>**SOLD**</h1>
<h2>"Salsa"</h2>
<h3>Gorgeous, thick mane and tail, coming 4 years old, 14.3H, crystal blue eyes from her daddy (not glass eyes like some paint horses), dark chocolate color, sweetheart, people loving, affectionate personality. We bred and raised her, and we hauled her parents all over the nation and to horse shows.
    She has been through our extensive round pen and trail training program, including obstacle course training. She has been to the ocean (even when she was a foal following her mama!), the lake, the forest, across creeks, logs, down the busy highway. She carries herself with class, with a sweet, soft racking gait and an easy, soft, smooth, slow canter. Salsa is a wonderful, gentle, sweet-natured family type forever horse. $6500</h3>
